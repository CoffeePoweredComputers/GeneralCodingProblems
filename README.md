# GeneralCodingProblems


This is a collection of what I would consider to be fundamental data structures and algorithms related coding challanges. Each directory includes problems directly related to that directory's name. These include:
* Graphs
* Linked Lists
* Hash Tables
* Hash Maps
* Trees
	* BST
	* AVL
	* Red-Black
	* Trie
* Dynamic Programming
